A follow up FYI for you Nick, Andy Daniels said to me on Friday he doesn’t think there’s any implication in Schrems II for data held in the UK.

Nick,

Agree with what you say, this is critical. Andy has already started looking at the current DPIAs and RBCs. Once this is completed, or potentially even in parallel, as a team we need to evaluate what this means for the adoption of new services as per the current plan. What will be absolutely key is guidance that comes from the ICO, HMG and the EDPB – so we also have to keep a watching brief.

As I said to Rick last night, this is not a full stop. It’s a re-evaluate, proceed with caution, possibly slow down, and adapt to new guidance/instruction as they emerge. Equally, we can’t say we weren’t warned – this has been brewing for a couple of years now!

Simon/Andy,

There’s a key question that I’m trying to get an answer to.  In Simon’s original email it stated “the ICO’s initial response has been to confirm that those using Privacy Shield for data export should continue to do so, but no new transfers should be implemented, until new guidance is issued”

What would fall into a new transfer?

I’m sure that us putting some data in a Microsoft data-centre in the US would fall into this category,  but what about transfer of data into a UK data-centre that just happens to be operated by a US company.

This is massively critical to the NDA Group’s IT strategies!

Both,

Thank you for the input. Let’s not continue this over email and with lengthy lists of attendees. I propose that we form a task force, of sorts, that can take the guidance and advice as it is issued and feedback to Rick, Matt and I so that we can make onward recommendations to Frank. I will be in touch.

Hi Nick,

Please note this is not US specific and there are other jurisdictions that have incompatible domestic laws (surveillance related), and we’re mapping those at the moment to provide situational awareness .

As a controller we have the legal obligation to ensure that the safeguards we have selected or relying upon can be upheld and provide the same level of protection to our data subjects that they are afforded within the UK. Some serious thought should be given as to whether the Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) alone will continue to provide adequate protection and how we can evidence, for accountability purposes, that we have undertaken appropriate due diligence of the recipient’s legal system to ensure that we comply.

Hopefully in the not too distant future we can start to see guidance and direction come from the ICO and the European Data Protection Board to assist us in our decision making.

In the table below is a list of some of the US legislation that conflicts with GDPR and what’s interesting is that the CLOUD Act (2018) is a Federal law which allows law enforcement agencies to obtain data from U.S. technology companies, regardless of where the data is stored globally.


Legal instrument, programme
or oversight mechanism	Purpose and significance
Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Act 1978 (FISA)	Federal law which establishes procedures for the physical and electronics surveillance and collection of ‘foreign intelligence information’ (i.e. not just for national security purposes).
Under Section 702 of FISA, the intelligence community can conduct mass surveillance, including foreign intelligence from non-Americans located outside the U.S.106 Provides the legal basis for PRISM and Upstream programmes and compels U.S. internet and technology companies to assist law enforcement and intelligence agencies.
A six-year extension to Section 702 was approved in January 2018 and its current authorisation expires in December 2023.
Executive Order 12333
(EO 12333)	The primary authority under which the NSA gathers foreign intelligence.
Signed by President Regan in 1981, it ‘established broad new surveillance authorities for the intelligence community, outside the scope of public law’.
EO 12333 is the legal basis of NSA surveillance for a wide range of purposes.
Patriot Act (2001)	Federal law, passed in response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, which enhances the powers and investigatory tools of law enforcement agencies. Reformed by the USA Freedom Act 2015.
Section 215, which provides a lawful basis for some forms of mass surveillance, is currently up for ‘renewal’. The House and Senate have both recently voted for an extension, albeit with amendments which are now being reviewed.
CLOUD Act (2018)	Federal law which allows law enforcement agencies to obtain data from U.S. technology companies, regardless of where the data is stored globally. Amends the Stored Communications Act (SCA, 1986).
PRISM	Secret NSA surveillance programme, revealed by Edward Snowden, which collects communications data (content and metadata) from U.S. internet companies. Operated under Section 702 of FISA.
Upstream collection	NSA programme for intercepting telephone and internet traffic from the ‘internet backbone’ (i.e. major domestic and foreign internet cables and switches), with the help of telecommunications companies.
Five Eyes (FVEY)	Intelligence sharing alliance between Australia, Canada, New Zealand, U.S. and UK.



Hope this helps.

Thanks,

Andy

Simon,

The vast majority of the data we are looking to store and process in public would stay within the UK shores.  There are only a few aspects of the overall services that can only operate in the US.

Does this ruling only impact on data stored/processed in the US?  Or does the fact that most of the public cloud providers are US based organisations also come into play?  I know there was always been some concerns around the US Cloud Act so just wondering if this ruling increases those concerns or if the two are completely separate.

Thanks,

Nick Sunley

Subject: [OFFICIAL] CJEU judgment on the processing of personal data outside of the European Economic Area (EEA)

All,

Please accept my apologies for the length of the email.

Find attached a briefing note relating to a recent CJEU decision regarding transfer of personal information outside of the EEA. In summary:

•	This judgment has rendered the Privacy Shield Agreement invalid. This means that where we have previously relied on legislation to protect the rights of EU citizens, this is no longer enforceable and potentially opens us to criticism/litigation as to how we manage subjects’ personal data should we engage in contracts with US-based organisations who are obligated to comply with US surveillance legislation;
•	Standard Contractual Clauses (the “SCCs”) for the transfer of personal data to data processors established outside of the EU may remain valid, so long as the protection afforded to EU citizens in respect of that data is essentially equivalent to that which it enjoys within the EU;
•	The CJEU has implied that each Data Protection Authority (in the UK this is the ICO) needs to do more with respect to these SCCs, even though the accountability rests with the Data Controller (the NDA, Sellafield, etc). This will be particularly important in the UK as Government have a very heavy reliance on Microsoft products and are adopting their and other public cloud technologies and services at pace;
•	The ICO’s initial response has been to confirm that those using Privacy Shield for data export should continue to do so, but no new transfers should be implemented, until new guidance is issued. Some legal experts believe that this is contradictory to the CJEU judgement and we therefore need to seek advice, urgently.

Why is this important?
•	This clearly includes Microsoft, Amazon, Google and other US cloud and managed service providers. This will impact on Rick and the group’s ICT transformation programmes;
•	Many of the services that we benefit from and, more importantly intend to rely upon by adopting public cloud services, rely on Privacy Shield and SCCs to ensure that we stay on the right side of the law;
•	All Data Controllers have a legal responsibility to ensure appropriate due diligence takes place to safeguard their processing of personal data, and that their data exports remain lawful;
•	Comments from certain legal experts include such as “(this) looks suspiciously like a privacy trade war” and will certainly therefore develop over the next few weeks and months.

What are we doing?
•	Maintaining a watching brief. Of note will be HMG statements, ICO guidance and the views of the European Data Protection Board.
•	However, we must also review all Data Privacy Impact Assessments and Risk Balanced Cases that have relied on Privacy Shield and/or SCCs as a matter of priority. My team have started this already;
•	We have already benefitted from expert legal input from David McIntosh, David Jenkins and colleagues through the legal framework contract. We will consider how best to take this forward now in light of the above and would appreciate your and your team’s continued support Neil;
•	Work with Matt, Joe and Rick’s teams for credible ‘plan Bs’. Taking all guidance and advice into account, should we deem the risk unacceptable to send personal information (and for that matter SNI, commercially sensitive and legally privileged information) outside of the EEA, then we will need to react quickly with alternative proposals in order to keep as many of the in-flight ICT transformation/upgrade projects on track as possible;
•	Keep our counterparts across the group informed of developments and NDA’s views. Frank, I would suggest that this will need to be reported to the Audit & Risk Assurance Committee as a minimum and I will undertake to do this for the September SIRO report unless you tell me otherwise.

I will keep you posted on developments.

Simon
